    "# Template Matching Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook outlines the steps necessary to generate, save, and load configurations for the `match-template` program through Python object and `yaml` files.\n",
    "Here, we focus on *how* to create and modify these configurations rather than the underlying code for parsing these configurations and running the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for using YAML configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `Py2DTM` package provides a basic CLI program and an object-oriented Python API for extending template matching into more complex workflows, it is useful to have a human-readable, easily editable, and shareable configuration file because:\n",
    "1. It increases reproducibility by keeping a record of exact parameters used for a particular run,\n",
    "2. It can be quickly modified during development, debugging, and testing without changing underlying code, and\n",
    "3. It can be replicated across large datasets (e.g. multiple images with similar configurations) for execution on distributed clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that storing configurations in a structured file format strikes a good balance between user-friendliness and programmatic control."
