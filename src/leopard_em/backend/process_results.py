    Z-score is accounting for the variation in image intensity and spurious correlations

    cross-correlation values are roughly normally distributed for pure noise, Z-score
    effectively becomes a measure of how unexpected (highly correlated to the reference
    template) a region is in the image. Note that we are looking at maxima of millions
    of Gaussian distributions, so Z-score has to be compared with a generalized extreme
    value distribution (GEV) to determine significance (done elsewhere).
